"# william_message_posts" 
In Chapter 4 we build our first database-backed project, a Message Board app. Django
provides a powerful ORM that allows us to write concise Python for our database
tables. Weâ€™ll explore the built-in admin app which provides a graphical way to interact
with our data and can be even used as a Content Management System (CMS) similar
to Wordpress. Of course we also write tests for all our code, store a remote copy on
Bitbucket, and deploy to Heroku.
